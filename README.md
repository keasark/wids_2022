WIDS DATATHON 2022

- Time: Jan 2022 - Feb 2022 

- Project Background:
Climate change is a globally relevant, urgent, and multi-faceted issue heavily impacted by energy policy and infrastructure.
It is possible to drastically reduce the energy consumption of buildings by a combination of easy-to-implement fixes and state-of-the-art strategies.


- Dataset Overview:
The dataset consists of variables that describe building characteristics and climate and weather variables for the regions in which the buildings are located.
Accurate predictions of energy consumption can help policymakers target retrofitting efforts to maximize emissions reductions.


- Evaluation Metric:
The evaluation metric for this competition is Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). 
The RMSE is commonly used measure of the differences between predicted values provided by a model and the actual observed values.


- Submission Format:
Submission Format
For every building (i.e. row) in the test dataset (test.csv), submission files contains two columns: id and site_eui.id should be an integer andsite_eui should be a real value.
For each row, these two values should be separated by a comma.
